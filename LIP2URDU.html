                The Habib University Undergraduate Research Symposium is a prestigious event that brings together young
                scholars to present their innovative research across various disciplines. It provides an excellent
                platform for students to showcase their work, engage with peers and experts, and gain recognition for
                their contributions to their respective fields. This year's symposium was a remarkable gathering of
                bright minds, fostering an environment of learning and collaboration.

                Our project, Lip2Urdu - Lip-to-Speech Synthesis in Urdu Language, delves into the fascinating area of
                teaching computers to interpret lip movements and generate corresponding speech in Urdu. Given that most
                existing research in lip-to-speech synthesis focuses on English, our work addresses a significant gap by
                developing a model tailored for the Urdu language. We curated a diverse corpus of muted video files
                featuring Urdu speakers and implemented a sequence-to-sequence architecture for lip-reading tasks. Our
                research not only advances the field of speech synthesis but also holds potential applications in areas
                such as surveillance, healthcare, and accessibility, particularly for individuals with hearing and
                speech impairments.
